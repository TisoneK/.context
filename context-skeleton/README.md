# .context/ — Agent Memory for This Repo

This directory is the project's institutional memory for AI agents. It is
**committed to git** and travels with the repo: every agent, on every
machine, with any model, pulls the same context — who worked on what, on
which system, what's open, what's decided, and what went wrong before.

The repo's docs (`README`, `docs/`) describe the **product**.
This directory describes the **process**.

```

Every file in this directory carries its own entry template in an HTML
comment at the top — read the file you're about to write to and follow
its template. Don't invent formats.

## Rules (for agents and humans)

1. **Read before you work.** Agents read this directory at session start
   (sessions → current task → backlog → inefficiencies → decisions) and
   update it at session end.
2. **Append-only logs are append-only.** `agents/sessions.md`,
   `inefficiencies/log.md`, `tasks/backlog.md`, and `plans/decisions.md`
   never lose entries. Corrections are appended, never edited in.
3. **Overwrite files are current-state only.** `tasks/current.md`,
   `workflows/active.md`, and the `system/` + `user/` files describe *now*;
   update them in place. History lives in the append-only logs.
4. **No secrets in tracked files — ever.** This directory is committed
   to git. Env var *names* and where secrets live are fine in shared
   files; values belong only in `secrets/`, whose own `.gitignore` keeps
   everything but its README out of git (rules in `secrets/README.md`).
5. **Commit with `chore(context):`.** Context updates are process, not
   product — keep them out of the changelog. One exception: review
   reports in `reviews/` commit as `docs(review):` — they're a
   deliverable, not bookkeeping.
6. **Inefficiency logging is mandatory.** Every session appends what
   slowed it down, honestly. That log is how the next session gets faster.
7. **Verify before trusting.** Entries reflect what was true when written.
   If the codebase disagrees, the codebase wins — append a correction.
