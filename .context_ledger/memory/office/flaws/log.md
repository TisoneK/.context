# Flaws Log (append-only — flows to the protocol package)

Friction caused by the `.context_ledger/` system or the protocol itself. See
`README.md` in this directory for the split between `flaws/` and
`inefficiencies/`.

Append-only, but prunable to cold storage: once an entry is explicitly
marked `RESOLVED` / `superseded` / fixed, move it **verbatim** into
`archive.md` in this directory so startup reads only the live entries.
`ledger-mem prune` reports which entries are archive-eligible (`--list`
names them); age alone never makes an entry eligible — an unresolved flaw
stays here as a live trap.

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy below the last entry:

## YYYY-MM-DD — <agent> / <model> (Session N)

- **Flaw:** <what in the protocol or .context_ledger/ system didn't work>
- **Symptom:** <what happened to the agent — the observable friction>
- **Root cause:** <why the protocol/.context_ledger/ let this happen>
- **Suggested fix:** <concrete change to the package — a step, a pitfall,
  a template, a rule>
- **Status:** open | fixed in package <commit-sha or date>

## 2026-09-11 — Kai / glm-5.3-flash (Session 2)

- **Flaw:** my own conduct — the session never set `office/tasks/current.md` at session start (protocol Step 3) while shipping the protocol; found at closeout when the file was still idle. Also late: the check-in happened only after the user prompted work to begin.
- **Symptom:** for the whole session the board said no task was in progress while a MAJOR release was underway — a peer or crashed-session check would have read the office as idle.
- **Root cause:** jumped from the user's design questions straight into plan mode and implementation; treated the kickoff's Step 2/3 ordering as satisfied because memory had been read.
- **Suggested fix:** package: the pre-commit/exit gates could warn (not block) when `tasks/current.md` was never written during a session whose commits exist. Habit: set current.md immediately after the check-in push, before any plan-mode work.
- **Status:** open — conduct miss, named per the repo's standing rule; tooling suggestion for a future patch.
## 2026-09-11 — Noor / glm-5.3-flash (Session 3)

- **Flaw:** my own conduct, two misses, named per the repo's standing rule. (1) `git add .context_ledger/memory/collaboration/events/` staged the whole directory and committed Kai's (S002) just-completed note event under my commit — in a shared checkout, staging must be per-file. (2) my first `release` event cited only the product commits and carried no `paths`, so it matched no claim and `ledger-collab check` fails on it permanently — the state machine has no supersede path.
- **Symptom:** (1) a peer's event file published by someone else's commit. (2) the integration gate failed twice; the trail held a permanently-red event.
- **Root cause:** directory-granularity staging while sharing the checkout with a live peer; and I had not internalized that a release must either cite the claim ID or carry overlapping `paths`.
- **Suggested fix:** package: `ledger-collab emit release` could default `--paths` from the referenced claim (or refuse to emit a release that matches no claim) — the same condition that fails at integration would then fail at emit time, where it is cheap to fix. For the malformed event there is no in-protocol supersede; repaired by removing the never-referenced file with the supersession documented in the replacement release (git history keeps the original byte-for-byte).
- **Status:** open — conduct miss named; release-defaults-paths is a tooling suggestion for a future patch.
